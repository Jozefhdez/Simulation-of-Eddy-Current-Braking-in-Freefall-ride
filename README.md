# Simulation-of-Eddy-Current-Braking-in-Freefall-ride
This project presents a detailed computational simulation of the magnetic braking effects (Eddy currents) on a gondola descending in an amusement park drop tower. Using MATLAB, the simulation models the interactions between a magnetic dipole and a current-carrying loop, illustrating the resulting deceleration forces.
